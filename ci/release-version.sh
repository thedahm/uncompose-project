# Resolve the version a release publishes, and refuse a tag that disagrees with it.
#
# Usage:
#   ci/release-version.sh                    print the source version
#   ci/release-version.sh <tag|ref>          print it, or fail if <tag> disagrees
#   ci/release-version.sh --manifest <path>  read another Cargo.toml (tests)
#
# The version is declared in exactly one place: `[workspace.package] version` in
# Cargo.toml. `pyproject.toml` takes it from there (`dynamic = ["version"]`, see
# ADR-0004), so the wheel's version is the workspace's by construction and there
# is nothing to keep in sync. A tag is only a *claim* about that number; this is
# where the claim is checked, before anything is built or published, so a
# mis-tagged release fails instead of publishing a lie (uncompose#97).
