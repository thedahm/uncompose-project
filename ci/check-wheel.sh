# Check that the wheel about to be published is the one the tag names.
#
# Usage: ci/check-wheel.sh [--pyproject <path>] <wheel-dir> <version>
#
# `ci/release-version.sh` checks the tag against the *source*; this checks the
# built artifact, so however the build got its version, a wheel that does not
# carry the released one never reaches PyPI. It also refuses a wheel that is not
# manylinux — PyPI rejects bare `linux_x86_64`, and finding that out at the
# upload step would mean a tag with no release behind it.
#
# Wheel names are `{distribution}-{version}-{python}-{abi}-{platform}.whl`
# (PEP 427), which is all this needs; no wheel is opened.
